content_title: NET as system resource
---

NET, as CPU and RAM, is a very important system resource in Antelope-based blockchains. NET is measured by the byte size of the transactions saved in the blockchain database and it is referred to as `net bandwidth` on the cleos get account command result. When a transaction is executed by the blockchain it consumes CPU and NET, therefore sufficient NET must be staked in order for transactions to complete.
